	Kamen Rider is a 1970's live-action superhero sci-fi drama created by manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori. The plot centers around Takeshi Hongo, a genius scientist and motorcyclist who 	is kidnapped by an evil organization known as Shocker. Shocker was attempting to create cyborg super soldiers in order to take over the world, but as Takeshi was being remodeled 	into a cyborg he managed to escape before he became brainwashed and managed to escape, vowing to use his newfound superhuman strength and abilities to take down Shocker wherever 	they appear. The series ended up being made into several spin-off series that continue to be made to this day, with a brief hiatus period between the 90's and 2000's. 	While the 	first two series continue the same plotline, further series became more self-contained, with later series airing once a week for about a year. Later Kamen Rider series 	are 	themed after specific concepts such as doctors, video games, magic, or space. Each series is different, with different actors and writers of each series. More 	recent series also 	became more and more toyetic as Kamen Rider as a series is aimed more towards children and young adults.
